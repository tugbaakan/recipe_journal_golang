Roasted roots & halloumi traybake with courgette tangles
DOLLOPS OF PESTO, FRESH APPLE & LAMB'S LETTUCE

GLUTEN-FREE  VEGETARIAN
“The kids’ favourite dinners are always the traybakes – we cannot get enough of them in our family! Our trick for keeping it fresh is to combine roasted ingredients with fresh ones and to top them with a good sauce or pesto, giving a mix of temperatures as well as textures. We use a spiraliser to create the vegetable tangles but a julienne peeler will also do the trick. ”
