Recipe Journal with GoLang

Previously, I had wrote a piece of code as recipe journal with Python. Now, I am learning Go Lang so I try to do the same with Go Lang as exercise.


How to run this code?
1. Download and install Go. You may find useful the video that I watch to start learning Go lang: ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8LgvuEBraI )
2. Open command line
3. Go to the directory that the code exists
4. Type 'go run recipe_journal_golang.go'
